# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built using **React + TypeScript**. The initial structure and many of the components were generated using AI, and I have customized and adapted parts of it using my own React knowledge.

# ‚úÖ What I Did / What I Learned

I used **AI tools** to generate the base structure and components of this portfolio.  
With my **React + TypeScript** knowledge, I customized parts of the website ‚Äî refining styles, updating content, and adjusting component logic.  
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **React components, props, state management, and responsive design**.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations / Areas for Improvement

Some **AI-generated code** remains unused or unrefined.  
A few components still contain boilerplate logic or imports to be cleaned up.  
Future updates will focus on **code optimization, accessibility, and better responsiveness**.
